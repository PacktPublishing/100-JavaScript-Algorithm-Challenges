Given a string, check if it can become a palindrome through a case change of some (possibly, none) letters.

**Example**

- For inputString = "AaBaa", the output should be
isCaseInsensitivePalindrome(inputString) = true.

"aabaa" is a palindrome as well as "AABAA", "aaBaa", etc

- For inputString = "abac", the output should be
isCaseInsensitivePalindrome(inputString) = false.

All the strings which can be obtained via changing case of some group of letters, i.e. "abac", "Abac", "aBAc" and 13 more, are not palindromes.

**Hints**
-   join()
-   reverse()
-   toLowerCase()
-   split()
