When you recently visited your little nephew, he told you a sad story: there's a bully at school who steals his lunch every day, and locks it away in his locker. He also leaves a note with a strange, coded message. Your nephew gave you one of the notes in hope that you can decipher it for him. And you did: it looks like all the digits in it are replaced with letters and vice versa. Digit 0 is replaced with 'a', 1 is replaced with 'b' and so on, with digit 9 replaced by 'j'.

The note is different every day, so you decide to write a function that will decipher it for your nephew on an ongoing basis.

**Example**
For note = "you'll n4v4r 6u4ss 8t: cdja", the output should be
stolenLunch(note) = "you'll never guess it: 2390".

**Hints**
-   split()
-   hasOwnProperty()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] string note**

A string consisting of lowercase English letters, digits, punctuation marks and whitespace characters (' ').

*Guaranteed constraints:*

0 ≤ note.length ≤ 500.

-   **[output] string**
The deciphered note.
