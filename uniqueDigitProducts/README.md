Let's call product(x) the product of x's digits. Given an array of integers a, calculate product(x) for each x in a, and return the number of distinct results you get.

**Example**
-   For a = [2, 8, 121, 42, 222, 23], the output should be
uniqueDigitProducts(a) = 3.

Here are the products of the array's elements:

2: product(2) = 2;
8: product(8) = 8;
121: product(121) = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2;
42: product(42) = 4 * 2 = 8;
222: product(222) = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8;
23: product(23) = 2 * 3 = 6.
As you can see, there are only 3 different products: 2, 6 and 8.

**Hints**
-   includes()
-   push()
-   toString()
-   split()
-   parseInt()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] array.integer a**

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ a.length ≤ 105,
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 109.

-   **[output] integer**

The number of different digit products in a.
