Fermat's factorization method is:
If a · b = n  (where a ≤ b), then there exist some c and d such that n = c^2 - d^2.
Your goal is to return for given n such c and d as an array.
Since we want c and d to be uniquely determined, in all test cases n is a semiprime number.

**Example**

- For n = 15, the output should be
fermactor(n) = [4, 1].
15 = 4^2 - 1^2.

**Hints**
-   Math.pow()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**

- **[input] integer n**

A semiprime number.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

10 < n < 109.

- **[output] array.integer**

c and d are guaranteed to be integers if the difference between a and b is even. For all test cases, this is true.
