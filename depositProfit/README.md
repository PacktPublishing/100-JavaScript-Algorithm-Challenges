You have deposited a specific amount of dollars into your bank account. Each year your balance increases at the same growth rate. Find out how long it would take for your balance to pass a specific threshold with the assumption that you don't make any additional deposits.

**Example**

For deposit = 100, rate = 20 and threshold = 170, the output should be
depositProfit(deposit, rate, threshold) = 3.

Each year the amount of money on your account increases by 20%. It means that throughout the years your balance would be:

- **year 0: 100;**
- **year 1: 120;**
- **year 2: 144;**
- **year 3: 172,8.**

Thus, it will take 3 years for your balance to pass the threshold, which is the answer.

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] integer deposit**

The initial deposit as a positive integer.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ deposit ≤ 100.

- **[input] integer rate**

The rate of increase. Each year the balance increases by the rate percent of the current sum.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ rate ≤ 100.

- **[input] integer threshold**

The target balance.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

deposit < threshold ≤ 200.

- **[output] integer**

The number of years it would take to hit the threshold.
