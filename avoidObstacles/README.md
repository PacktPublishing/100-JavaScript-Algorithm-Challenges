You are given an array of integers representing coordinates of obstacles situated on a straight line.

Assume that you are jumping from the point with coordinate 0 to the right. You are allowed only to make jumps of the same length represented by some integer.

Find the minimal length of the jump enough to avoid all the obstacles.

**Example**

For inputArray = [5, 3, 6, 7, 9], the output should be
avoidObstacles(inputArray) = 4.

**Hints**
-   sort()
-   every()

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] array.integer inputArray**

Non-empty array of positive integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

2 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 10,

1 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 40.

- **[output] integer**

The desired length.
