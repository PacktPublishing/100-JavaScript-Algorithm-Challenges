Thumbtack helps Professionals (Pros) grow their business by identifying new customers. Upon registering on Thumbtack, a Pro specifies which categories of services they provide. To help match customer requests with qualified Pros, Thumbtack maintains a list of Pros grouped by service categories.

Given a list of pros and their category preferences, return the list of Pros for each category.

**Example**

For pros = ["Jack", "Leon", "Maria"] and

preferences = [ ["Computer repair", "Handyman", "House cleaning"],
               ["Computer lessons", "Computer repair", "Data recovery service"],
               ["Computer lessons", "House cleaning"]]

               the output should be

proCategorization(pros, preferences) = [ [ ["Computer lessons"], ["Leon", "Maria"]],
                                        [ ["Computer repair"], ["Jack", "Leon"]],
                                        [ ["Data recovery service"], ["Leon"]],
                                        [ ["Handyman"], ["Jack"]],
                                        [ ["House cleaning"], ["Jack", "Maria"]]]

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] array.string pros**

A sorted non-empty array of unique strings consisting of English letters.

Here and below we assume that strings are sorted lexicographically.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ pros.length ≤ 5,
3 ≤ pros[i].length ≤ 10.

- **[input] array.array.string preferences**

Array of the same length as pros. For each valid i preferences[i] is a sorted array of unique elements, representing the categories the ith Pro provides services in.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ preferences.length ≤ 5,
1 ≤ preferences[i].length ≤ 10,
3 ≤ preferences[i][j].length ≤ 25.

-   **[output] array.array.array.string**
Array of category descriptions sorted by category names. Each category should be listed in the following format: [[<category>], [<Pro1>, <Pro2>...]] where <category> is a category name, and <Proi> is a Pro that provides services in it.

Each category present in preferences should be returned (in the right order), and Pros in each subarray should be sorted.
