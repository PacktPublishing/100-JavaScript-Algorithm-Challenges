Note: Write a solution that only iterates over the string once and uses O(1) additional memory, since this is what you would be asked to do during a real interview.

Given a string s, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.

**Example**

-   For s = "abacabad", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = 'c'.

There are 2 non-repeating characters in the string: 'c' and 'd'. Return c since it appears in the string first.

-   For s = "abacabaabacaba", the output should be
firstNotRepeatingCharacter(s) = '_'.

There are no characters in this string that do not repeat.

**Hints**
-   split()
-   hasOwnProperty()


**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**

- **[input] string s**
  A string that contains only lowercase English letters.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^5.

- **[output] char**
The first non-repeating character in s, or '_' if there are no characters that do not repeat.
