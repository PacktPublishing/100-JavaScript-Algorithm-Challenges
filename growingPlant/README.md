Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters. Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

**Example**

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10 and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] integer upSpeed**

A positive integer representing the daily growth.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

5 ≤ upSpeed ≤ 100.

- **[input] integer downSpeed**

A positive integer representing the nightly decline.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

2 ≤ downSpeed < upSpeed.

- **[input] integer desiredHeight**

A positive integer representing the threshold.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

4 ≤ desiredHeight ≤ 1000.

- **[output] integer**

The number of days that it will take for the plant to reach/pass desiredHeight (including the last day in the total count).
