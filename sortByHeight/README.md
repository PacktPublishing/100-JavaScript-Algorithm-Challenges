Some people are standing in a row in a park. There are trees between them which cannot be moved. Your task is to rearrange the people by their heights in a non-descending order without moving the trees.

**Example**

For a = [-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180], the output should be
sortByHeight(a) = [-1, 150, 160, 170, -1, -1, 180, 190].

**Hinits**
-   filter()
-   sort()

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] array.integer a**

If a[i] = -1, then the ith position is occupied by a tree. Otherwise a[i] is the height of a person standing in the ith position.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

5 ≤ a.length ≤ 15,

-1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 200.

**[output] array.integer**

Sorted array a with all the trees untouched.
