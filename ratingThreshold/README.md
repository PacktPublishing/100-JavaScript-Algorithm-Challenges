In Thumbtack, users are able to rate Pros based on their experience working with them. Each rating is an integer ranging from 1 to 5, and all ratings are averaged to produce a single number rating for any given Pro. Those Pros who have a rating lower than a specified threshold are manually reviewed by Thumbtack staff to ensure high quality of service.

You're given a list of ratings for some Pros. Find out which Pros should be manually reviewed.

**Example**

For threshold = 3.5 and

ratings = [[3, 4],
           [3, 3, 3, 4],
           [4]]
the output should be ratingThreshold(threshold, ratings) = [1].

Assume that we have 3 Pros that have received the following ratings: [3, 4], [3, 3, 3, 4] and [4]. Then
And if threshold = 3.5 the answer is ratingThreshold(threshold, ratings) = [1].
The first Pro's rating is 3.5, the second one's is 3.25, and the last one's is 4, so only the second Pro should be reviewed manually (the output is their 0-based index).

**Hints**
-   push()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] float threshold**

A positive number not greater than 5. Those Pros whose ratings are lower than threshold should be manually reviewed.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ threshold ≤ 5.

- **[input] array.array.integer ratings**

For each valid i, ratings[i] is a non-empty array that represents the last ratings the ith Pro has received.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

0 ≤ ratings.length ≤ 5,
1 ≤ ratings[i].length ≤ 15,
1 ≤ ratings[i][j] ≤ 5.

- [output] array.integer

0-based indices of the Pros that should be reviewed, sorted in ascending order.
