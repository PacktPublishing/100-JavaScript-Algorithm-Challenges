Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.

**Example**

- For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = false;

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

- For sequence = [1, 3, 2], the output should be
almostIncreasingSequence(sequence) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].

**Hints**
-   Nope

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] array.integer sequence**

*Guaranteed constraints:*

2 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 105,

-105 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 105.

**[output] boolean**

Return true if it is possible to remove one element from the array in order to get a strictly increasing sequence, otherwise return false.
