Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer N such that:

-   N is divisible by divisor.
-   N is less than or equal to bound.
-   N is greater than 0.

It is guaranteed that such a number exists.

**Example**

For divisor = 3 and bound = 10, the output should be
maxMultiple(divisor, bound) = 9.

The largest integer divisible by 3 and not larger than 10 is 9.

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**
- **[input] integer divisor**

*Guaranteed constraints:*

2 ≤ divisor ≤ 10.

-   **[input] integer bound

*Guaranteed constraints:*

5 ≤ bound ≤ 100.

-   **[output] integer**
The largest integer not greater than bound that is divisible by divisor.
