Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half.

Given a ticket number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

**Example**

- For n = 1230, the output should be
isLucky(n) = true;
- For n = 239017, the output should be
isLucky(n) = false.

**Hints**
-   toString()
-   subString()
-   split()
-   reduce()
-   parseInt()
