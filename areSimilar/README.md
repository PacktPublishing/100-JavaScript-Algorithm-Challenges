Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

Given two arrays a and b, check whether they are similar.

**Example**

- For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

- For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = true.

We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

- For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
areSimilar(a, b) = false.

Any swap of any two elements either in a or in b won't make a and b equal.

**Hints**
-   toString()
-   reverse()

**Input/Output**

- **[time limit] 4000ms (js)**
- **[input] array.integer a**

Array of integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

3 ≤ a.length ≤ 105,

1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1000.

- **[input] array.integer b**

Array of integers of the same length as a.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

b.length = a.length,

1 ≤ b[i] ≤ 1000.

**[output] boolean**

true if a and b are similar, false otherwise.
