---
You have two integer arrays, a and b, and an integer target value v. Determine whether there is a pair of numbers, where one number is taken from a and the other from b, that can be added together to get a sum of v. Return true if such a pair exists, otherwise return false.

**Example**
For a = [1, 2, 3], b = [10, 20, 30, 40], and v = 42, the output should be
sumOfTwo(a, b, v) = true.

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] array.integer a**

An array of integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

0 ≤ a.length ≤ 105,
-109 ≤ a[i] ≤ 109.

-   **[input] array.integer b**

An array of integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

0 ≤ b.length ≤ 105,
-109 ≤ b[i] ≤ 109.

-   *[input] integer v**

*Guaranteed constraints:*

-109 ≤ v ≤ 109.

-   **[output] boolean**

true if there are two elements from a and b which add up to v, and false otherwise.
