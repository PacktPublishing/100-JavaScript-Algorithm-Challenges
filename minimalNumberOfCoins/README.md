You find yourself in Bananaland trying to buy a banana. You are super rich so you have an unlimited supply of banana-coins, but you are trying to use as few coins as possible.

The coin values available in Bananaland are stored in a sorted array coins. coins[0] = 1, and for each i (0 &lt; i &lt; coins.length) coins[i] is divisible by coins[i - 1]. Find the minimal number of banana-coins you'll have to spend to buy a banana given the banana's price.

**Example**

For coins = [1, 2, 10] and price = 28, the output should be
minimalNumberOfCoins(coins, price) = 6.

You have to use 10 twice, and 2 four times.

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] array.integer coins**

The coin values available in Bananaland.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

1 ≤ coins.length ≤ 5,

1 ≤ coins[i] ≤ 120.

- **[input] integer price**

A positive integer representing the price of the banana.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

8 ≤ price ≤ 250.

-   **[output] integer**

The minimal number of coins you can use to buy the banana.
