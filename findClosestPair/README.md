Given an array of integers numbers, we'd like to find the closest pair of elements that add up to sum. Return the distance between the closest pair (absolute difference between the two indices). If there isn't a pair that adds up to sum, return -1.

**Example**

- For numbers = [1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 0] and sum = 5 the output should be findClosestPair(numbers, sum) = 2. 1 and 4 have a sum of 5, but 2 and 3 are closer.

-   For numbers = [2, 3, 7] and sum = 8 the output should be findClosestPair(numbers, sum) = -1. There are no pairs that have a sum of 8.

**Hints**
-   Math.abs()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**

- **[input] array.integer numbers**

An array of integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

2 ≤ numbers.length ≤ 3 · 105
-1000 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 1000

- **[input] integer sum**

An integer representing the sum of the pair we're looking for.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

-2000 ≤ sum ≤ 2000

- **[output] integer**

An integer representing the difference between the indices of the closest pair of elements that add up to sum (or -1 if there isn't one).
