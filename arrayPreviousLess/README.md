---
Given array of integers, for each position i, search among the previous positions for the last (from the left) position that contains a smaller value. Store this value at position i in the answer. If no such value can be found, store -1 instead.

**Example**

For items = [3, 5, 2, 4, 5], the output should be
arrayPreviousLess(items) = [-1, 3, -1, 2, 4].

**Hints**
-   unshift()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 5 seconds (ts)**
- **[input] array.integer items**

    Non-empty array of positive integers.

*Guaranteed constraints:*

3 ≤ items.length ≤ 15,

1 ≤ items[i] ≤ 200.

- **[output] array.integer**

    Array containing answer values computed as described above.
