Given a rectangular matrix and integers a and b, consider the union of the ath row and the bth (both 0-based) column of the matrix (i.e. all cells that belong either to the ath row or to the bth column, or to both). Return sum of all elements of that union.

**Example**
-   For

matrix = [[1, 1, 1, 1], 
          [2, 2, 2, 2], 
          [3, 3, 3, 3]]
a = 1 and b = 3, the output should be
crossingSum(matrix, a, b) = 12.

Here (2 + 2 + 2 + 2) + (1 + 3) = 12.

**Hints**
-   reduce()

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**
- **[input] array.array.integer matrix**
    2-dimensional array of integers representing a rectangular matrix.

    *Guaranteed constraints:*

    1 ≤ matrix.length ≤ 5,
    1 ≤ matrix[0].length ≤ 5,
    1 ≤ matrix[i][j] ≤ 100. 

- **[input] integer a**
    A non-negative integer less than the number of matrix rows.

    *Guaranteed constraints:*
    0 ≤ a < matrix.length.

-   **[input] integer b**
    A non-negative integer less than the number of matrix columns.

    *Guaranteed constraints:*
    0 ≤ b < matrix[i].length.

-   **[output] integer**
